## Product demo

A functional prototype is currently available.  
This demo illustrates how Arika operates upstream of modeling—standardizing biological data representations, validating assumptions, and supporting downstream reasoning.


## Demo overview

This short walkthrough demonstrates how Arika works with real biological data to:

- transform raw inputs into standardized, validated representations,
- surface hidden assumptions early in the pipeline,
- support reasoning and configuration decisions through an AI copilot.



## Access

If you’d like to see the prototype in action or discuss a specific use case, get in touch.
