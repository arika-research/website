## Problem

Recent advances in biotechnology and AI have accelerated modeling and discovery workflows.
However, pipeline reliability depends on upstream infrastructure that is often under-specified or inconsistently designed.

In particular, RNA-derived data representations can introduce hidden assumptions, increase validation overhead, and slow development in ways that are frequently overlooked.

## Our Focus

Arika Research is an infrastructure company focused on foundational challenges in AI-enabled biology.
We build systems that act as an AI copilot for biological data infrastructure—guiding how data is represented, aligned, and validated before it reaches downstream models.

Our initial work focuses on RNA-derived data, where representational ambiguity and preprocessing variability significantly affect AI performance.
Rather than introducing new predictive models, Arika operates upstream: formalizing representation semantics, alignment rules, and validation mechanisms that allow AI systems to reason over biological data more reliably.
